# Task Management App MVP

## Overview
A Python-based app to help overcome task paralysis by breaking down tasks, scheduling, and using AI for assistance. The app will be available as a web application and an Apple OS app.

## Core Features
1. **Task Breakdown**
   - Users can create projects and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - Each task can have a description, due date, and priority level.

2. **Gamification**
   - Users earn points or unlock rewards for completing tasks.
   - Achievement badges or levels for milestones.

3. **Scheduling**
   - A calendar view to assign tasks to specific dates and times.
   - Reminders and notifications to keep users on track.

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - A dashboard displaying completed tasks, points earned, and upcoming deadlines.
   - Visual representation of progress.

5. **AI Integration**
   - Use an LLM via API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to help break down complex tasks, provide suggestions, and offer motivational prompts.

## Development Steps
1. **Define Requirements**
   - List the essential features and functionalities for both web and Apple OS versions.

2. **Create Wireframes**
   - Sketch the main screens and user flow for both platforms.

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Python, Flask/Django for the backend.
   - Use React for the web front-end and Swift for the Apple OS app.

4. **Database Integration**
   - Use Supabase as the backend database.
   - Set up tables for tasks, users, and any additional data.
   - Implement Supabase Auth for user authentication.
   - Integrate real-time updates for task tracking.

5. **Develop Core Features**
   - Implement task creation, gamification, and scheduling.
   - Integrate the LLM for task breakdown.

6. **User Interface**
   - Develop the web front-end using React.
   - Develop the Apple OS app using Swift.

7. **Testing and Feedback**
   - Test the app thoroughly on both platforms and gather feedback.
   - Refine features based on user input.

8. **Iteration and Refinement**
   - Improve the UI/UX, fix bugs, and add additional enhancements.
